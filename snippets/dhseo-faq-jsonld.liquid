CZ stones are a manufactured crystalline material that is used as an alternative to diamonds. The synthetic substance is colorless, rigid and immaculate.

Over the years, gold plating deteriorates and may peel off, revealing the primary metal beneath. Plating may last up to three to four years with adequate maintenance.
